Stuff left doing
================

 - add draw/stroke/fillRectangle
 - Canvas struct - possibly use derived SpriteCanvas, should the case
   come up often enough (like in slideview, where we have it extra
   currently)
 - review drawing method input parameters - do structs make sense?
   (uno structs are dumb, so people usually convert anyway from
    language-specific classes, _at the callsite_)
   candidates:
   - X*Bitmap.idl
   - XParametricPolyPolygon2D.idl
   - XTextLayout.idl
 - review geometry structs, are there any unused after the above?
 - remove extraneous throw specs from canvas and slideshow - or does
   that break dbgutil builds?
 - grep for TODO-NYI
 - migrate emf+ renderer over to primitives
 - implement stateful canvas processor (e.g. for the color changes?)
   -or- decorate primitives with color modifiers e.g.
 - do we need viewstate at the canvas to pass around?

 - how much of the wrapper state in cppcanvas _was_ actually useful?
